Cards Against Humanity is a party game for horrible people.

If you're unfamiliar with the game, check out: http://cardsagainsthumanity.com

The lovely people at CAH have licenced it under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 2.0 license, meaning that we can come up with our own expansion packs for added hilarity. 

This is a repo for coming up with cards related to programming general, and specifically iOS development / Objective-C / Cocoa / Swift / Apple. 

Please keep the format as follows:

For black cards:
[Black]["Instead of the usual WWDC jacket, next year Apple will be giving out ____________ to developers."]

For white cards:
[White]["Johnny Ive's invisible burrito."]
